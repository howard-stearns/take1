# take1

A prototype to:
1. have a fun and easy way for people to show their content, and get others to visit.
2. use out-of-band channels like Facebook to get recognition for High Fidelity as well as for the content creators.

## Concept

* The “Take 1” button captures snapshot of current scene from user's viewpoint.
* The pictures/movies aredisplayed on our site, with a Facebook Like button on each, in most-Liked order.
* Clicking the user story from Facebook takes people to a version of our page with that gif on top.
* Clicking the picture takes you to that location in that domain.

## TODO:

* Individual pages.
* Main index page.
* Individual pages with continued scroller.
* Facebook app setup, and Like buttons.
* Upload single-frame snapshot from HighFidelity Interface
* Persist data.
* Authentication for uploads.
* Upload six seconds of movie from HighFidelity. (Multiple images with server stitching into .gif using imagemagik or equivalent.)
* Large numbers (billions):
  ** Persist a pre-sorted list.
  ** Paged display.
  ** Infinite-scroller.
* Style pages.
* SEO using mnemonic URLs instead of GUIDs.
* Ability to "like" from in-world.
* Queryable database. (Prototype functionality is all direct-indexed key-value store, rather than traversable.)
* Ability to display all such content for the same domain.
* Creator info, and ability to display all domains (all content?) from this creator.
* Uploader provides canned options of type and things to say about the picture. (Must work from hand controller.)
* Ability to visit related content from in-world. (By creator, by domain, by type)
* Identity separate from location: handles being moved within world, and same object appearing in multiple worlds.
